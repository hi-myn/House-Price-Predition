# House Price Prediction in Python - Full Machine Learning Project

## Overview
In this project, we build machine learning models to predict house prices using a dataset of house characteristics. The aim is to develop accurate models that can predict house prices based on these characteristics.

## Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Main Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Steps to Execute the Project
### Install Python and Jupyter Lab:
- If you don't already have Python installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- To install Jupyter Lab, you can use pip by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
  pip install jupyterlab
```

### Clone the Repository:
- Clone this repository in your local environment using the following command:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository_name.git
```
Replace `your_username` and `repository_name` with the details of your repository on GitHub.

### Open the Project in Jupyter Lab:
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository using the terminal.
- Start Jupyter Lab by running the following command:
```bash 
jupyter lab
```

- This will open a new tab in your default browser with the Jupyter Lab environment.

### Run the Project Notebook:
- In Jupyter Lab, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
- Open the notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb`.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the project.

## Project Structure
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: This is the main project file containing the source code and documentation in Jupyter notebook format.
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used in the project.
